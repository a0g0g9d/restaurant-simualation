This is a simulation of a restaurant.

Usage:
1. Simply run `make` inside the project root directory. 
2. Create a file named `input.txt` which takes in the input for this program.
3. Run `make run`  inside project root directory to generate the output of the program inside `output.txt`.

Note: Program simulation takes time and you can check the progress of the program inside `output.txt`.

Assumptions:

This program only takes orders of diners which arrive before or on 120 seconds mark. Any diner who arrives at the restaurant after 120 seconds mark will be discarded. Added the input and output for the first testcase.
